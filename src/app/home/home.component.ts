                    Originally from Southern California, in 2010 I moved to Salt
                    Lake City, Utah in pursuit of a career in software
                    development. Since then I've had the privilege to work with
                    some of the very best engineers in the digital-agency scene.
                    I've also been able to do work for some of the world's
                    largest brands including: Google, PepsiCo, Viacom and
                    Microsoft.
